axiosInstance is a custom configuration of the Axios HTTP client used to centralize the setup of API requests and handle certain behaviors such as token management and error handling.

Here’s a breakdown of its key features:

Custom Axios Instance:

An Axios instance is created using axios.create() with a specific configuration, such as the base URL for the API (baseURL).
This instance is used across your application to make HTTP requests.
Request Interceptor:

The request interceptor allows you to modify every request before it’s sent.
In this case, the interceptor adds an Authorization header with a Bearer token (either from localStorage or sessionStorage) if the token exists. This is useful for authenticated API requests.
Response Interceptor:

The response interceptor handles the server’s response globally.
If the response status is 401 Unauthorized, the interceptor attempts to refresh the access token by sending the stored refreshToken to the server’s refresh endpoint.
If the token refresh is successful, it updates the stored access token and retries the original request.
If token refresh fails (e.g., refresh token is invalid or expired), it removes the stored tokens and redirects the user to the login page.
Error Handling:

Errors such as invalid tokens or network issues are caught by the response interceptor, preventing repetitive error-handling logic throughout your components.
Reuse Across Components:

By storing the Axios instance in a separate file (e.g., utils/axiosInstance.js), you ensure that the configuration and interceptors are applied globally across your app.
Components only need to import and use this instance to make API calls, simplifying code maintenance.
Benefits:
Centralized Configuration: You manage all Axios settings, including interceptors, in one place.
Token Management: Automatic handling of authorization tokens and refreshing expired tokens.
Error Handling: Global error handling for common issues like unauthorized requests.
Cleaner Code: Avoid repetitive configuration in every component by using the instance throughout the app.
